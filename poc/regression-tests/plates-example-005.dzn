%%% Small test example %%%
%% The data is similar to that in pl-example05.dzn
%% The old model needed the total number of controls, generating two plates automatically
%% The new model has been adapted to increase the number of plates depending on the number of replicates


%% Plate dimentions: (this is a 96-well plate)
num_rows = 8; %% height
num_cols = 12; %% width

vertical_cell_lines	 = 1;
horizontal_cell_lines = 1;
size_empty_edge = 1;

concentrations_on_different_rows = true;
concentrations_on_different_columns = true;

replicates_on_different_plates = true;
replicates_on_same_plate = false;

%% Compounds %%
num_compounds = 2;

compound_concentrations	 = [1,1]; 

compound_replicates	 = [2| i in 1..num_compounds]; 

compound_concentration_names = [|"comp-conc1"|"comb-conc1"|];

compound_names = ["BPA","BPA+H"]; 


%% Controls %%

num_controls = 4;

control_replicates = [5,5,5,5];

control_concentrations = [2 | i in 1..num_controls];

control_names = ["pos","neg","blank","dmso"];

control_concentration_names =  array2d(1..num_controls, 1..2,["cont\(ceil(i/1))-conc\((i mod 1) + 1)" | i in 1..num_controls*2]);
