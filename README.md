**LayoutCreator** (I'm still working on the name!) is a flexible
constraint-programming model representing the Plate Layout Design
problem. **LayoutCreator** was developed with the goal of helping
researchers plan well-designed experiments by creating a robust
microplate layout and thus reducing the rate of (partial) microplate
rejection.<sup>[1](#RefModRef2020)</sup>

**LayoutCreator**  is easy and straightforward to use. The current
model guarantees the following constraints:

* The outermost rows and columns can be left empty in order to reduce
errors due to the edge effect.
* For each compound or combination thereof:
  - all concentration levels of a given replica appear on the same
  plate.
  - each concentration level appears on a different row and column.
* If possible, the replicated compounds and combinations appear on a
different plate.
* For each type of control and concentration, the difference in number
between plates is at most 1.
* Controls of the same kind are separated by at least 1 well in any
direction.
* If empty wells are allowed (other than those used to reduce the edge
effect), they are placed as close to the border as possible.

Using **LayoutCreator** does not require any programming knowledge.
Users just need to write down the necessary information such as number
of compounds, combinations, controls, etc in a simple text file and
click run!

The output is a list in .csv format containing plate ID, well, content
(compound, combination or control), concentration, and latex name,
meant to be used as input for automatic tools. (TODO: visualize the
layout using latex)

We believe **LayoutCreator** is the first attempt to use constraint
programming to design microplate layouts. Due to the use of MiniZinc,<sup>[2](#RefMiniZinc)</sup>
a high level constraint modelling language, **LayoutCreator** is
highly customizable.

## Installation and Usage

* Download and install [MiniZinc](https://www.minizinc.org/).
* Clone this repo or download our model plate-design.mzn located in this repository.
* Fill in the specific details of your experiment in a a copy of
empty-file.dzn. Alternatively, you can modify any of the example .dzn
files. (TODO: add an example input file in JSON)

### Using the MiniZinc IDE 
* Select Gecode as solver.<sup>[3](#RefGecode)</sup>
* Run!
* You can change the random seed to obtain a different layout for the
same input file.


<a name="command-line"></a>
### Using the command line
* Type something and magic happens!
